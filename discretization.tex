The simulation domain is mapped to a aquidistant grid. In z-direction the distance between each grid point simply equals the discretization of a unit circle ($h_z= \frac{2\pi}{n_z}$ or going around a Tokamak once). The distance between each grid point in x and y direction is fixed by a single parameter forcing both to be equal ($h_x = h_y$). This reduces the complexity of some finite differences schemes.
