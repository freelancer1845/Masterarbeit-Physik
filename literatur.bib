Most of the earlier results can be found in the excellent books by Varga (Matrix Iterative Analysis, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1962) Young (Iterative Solution of Large Linear systems, Academic Press, New York, 1971) and Berman and Plemmons (Nonnegative Matrices in the Mathematical Sciences, SIAM, Philadelphia, PA, 1994) while some of the most recent ones are given in the bibliography of this paper. In this survey, both the point and the block SOR methods are considered for the solution of a linear system of the form Ax=b, where A∈Cn,n and b∈Cn⧹{0}. Some general results concerning the SOR and related methods are given and also some more specific ones in cases where A happens to possess some further property, e.g., positive definiteness, L-, M-, H-matrix property, p-cyclic consistently ordered property etc."

 abstract = {A method for the solution of Poisson's equation in a rectangle, based on the relation between the Fourier coefficients for the solution and those for the right-hand side, is developed. The Fast Fourier Transform is used for the computation and its influence on the accuracy is studied. Error estimates are given and the method is shown to be second order accurate under certain general conditions on the smoothness of the solution. The accuracy is found to be limited by the lack of smoothness of the periodic extension of the inhomogeneous term. Higher order methods are then derived with the aid of special solutions. This reduces the problem to a case with sufficiently smooth data. A comparison of accuracy and efficiency is made between our Fourier method and the Buneman algorithm for the solution of the standard finite difference formulae.},

	title = {Computation of turbulence in magnetically confined plasmas},
	journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
	abstract = {Plasmas are magnetically confined if the orbits of the charged particles around the magnetic field lines are small compared to the system size. Nevertheless, particles and energy are lost via transport resulting from the fluid-like drifts of these orbits across the magnetic field. Computation of this type of low frequency electromagnetic turbulence is introduced with emphasis on nonlinear character and energetics. The physical situation is low frequency dynamics with perpendicular forces in quasistatic balance and fast gyrofrequency leading to treating the orbit gyrocentres rather than the particles themselves. The broadband turbulence necessarily involves the ion gyroradius scale in any tokamak application. Hence the use of ‘gyrofluid’ and ‘gyrokinetic’ computational models. Computations must also treat the interplay between electromagnetic wave dynamics along the magnetic field and fluid-like turbulence across it, with a method independently checked against both of these sub-processes. Tokamak core and edge turbulence differ according to the ratios of the parallel (electron) and perpendicular (E-cross-B) transit frequencies. The turbulence is also in energetic contact with flows and currents associated with the equilibrium, so computations must be well behaved over very long run times and at least the perturbed equilibrium carried self-consistently. These considerations are illustrated by treating the case of ion temperature gradient instabilities giving rise to turbulence which is then suppressed by self generated E-cross-B flows. The methods of diagnosis of the physical processes are detailed. The situation of edge turbulence and interaction with the equilibrium is briefly addressed.}

	journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
	abstract = {Flux-driven global gyrokinetic codes are now mature enough to make predictions in terms of turbulence and transport in tokamak plasmas. Some of the recent breakthroughs of three such codes, namely GYSELA, ORB5 and XGC1, are reported and compared wherever appropriate. In all three codes, turbulent transport appears to be mediated by avalanche-like events, for a broad range of ρ* = ρi/a values, ratio of the gyro-radius over the minor radius. Still, the radial correlation length scales with ρi, leading to the gyro-Bohm scaling of the effective transport coefficient below ρ* ≈ 1/300. The possible explanation could be due to the fact that avalanches remain meso-scale due to the interaction with zonal flows, whose characteristic radial wavelength appears to be almost independent of the system size. As a result of the radial corrugation of the turbulence driven zonal and mean flows, the shear of the radial electric field can be significantly underestimated if poloidal rotation is assumed to be governed by the neoclassical theory, especially at low collisionality. Indeed, the turbulence contribution to the poloidal rotation increases when collisionality decreases. Finally, the numerical verification of toroidal momentum balance shows that both neoclassical and turbulent contributions to the Reynolds' stress tensor play the dominant role. The phase space analysis further reveals that barely passing supra-thermal particles mostly contribute to the toroidal flow generation, consistently with quasi-linear predictions.}

	abstract = {Performance prediction for ITER is based upon the ubiquitous experimental observation that the plasma energy confinement in the device core is strongly coupled to the edge confinement for an unknown reason. The coupling time-scale is much shorter than the plasma transport time-scale. In order to understand this critical observation, a multi-scale turbulence-neoclassical simulation of integrated edge-core plasma in a realistic diverted geometry is a necessity, but has been a formidable task. Thanks to the recent development in high performance computing, we have succeeded in the integrated multiscale gyrokinetic simulation of the ion-temperature-gradient driven turbulence in realistic diverted tokamak geometry for the first time. It is found that modification of the self-organized criticality in the core plasma by nonlocal core-edge coupling of ITG turbulence can be responsible for the core-edge confinement coupling.}
