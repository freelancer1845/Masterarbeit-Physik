\chapter{Float vs Double precision} \label{sec:float-vs-double}
\renewcommand{\thechapter}{A}
This appendix should serve as a small evaluation whether using float (4 byte; $\approx 7$ decimals) or double (8 byte; $\approx 16$ decimals) precision in the simulation has a notable impact on the results. Usually computers have two times the speed when using float operations especially if the problem is memory bound thus if the numeric problem is not effected \textit{too much} by the lower precision it is preferable.\newline
For this assertion the first parameter set from \autoref{sec:polarization_equation_evaluation} is run in float precision and the results are compared.
