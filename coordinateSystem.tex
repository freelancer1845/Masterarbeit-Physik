A Flux-Tube coordinate system is employed.
The coordinate system in the simulation code has the letters $z$ $x$ and $y$. They map to the following coordinates as they are introduced in \cite{doi:10.1063/1.1335832}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x = r - a$   (i. e. radial distance)
    \item $y = q\theta - \xi$ (i. e. shear shifted (by $q\theta$) polodial angle)
    \item $z = \theta$ (i. e. torodial angle/flux surfaces)
\end{itemize} 
where $a:=minor\, Radius$, $\xi \in [0,2\pi]$, $\theta \in [-\pi,\pi]$ and $\theta = 0$ is the magnetic surface at the \textit{outboard-midplane}.\\
Thus if we chose $z=[0,8]$ we have eight $x-y$ simulation planes evenly distributed around the torus following the magnetic field lines (i. e. field-aligned).The deformation of the $x-y$ planes is accounted for by the shift-parameter which influences the parallel derivatives.\newline
It is noteworthy that the $y$ coordinate doesn't actually cover the full polodial disc. This might seem counter intuitive but as is show in \cite{ScottFluxTube} modes covering the whole polodial disc are suppressed. In the reference this is shown by the analysis of the fourier decomposition of a general \textit{physical quantity} that obeys continuity constraints in the geometry (for instance the electron density $n_e$).
This constraint on the allowed wavelengths (modes) justifies the use of a Flux-Tube coordinate system where the \textit{Tube} follows a magnetic field line around the torus. Therefore the simulation doesn't cover a complete Tokamak but only represents the flux surfaces of a \textit{big enough} region that is also \textit{fine} enough to resolve the necessary modes that are suspected to be responsible for turbulent transport effects.\newline
One advantage is the reduction of grid size which reduces the needed computational effort another is that less artificial modes are exited.
